# Bomberman Game

A classic Bomberman implementation built with Python and Pygame, featuring clean modular architecture and modern game development practices.

## ✨ Features

- **State Management** - Seamless transitions between menu, game, and pause states
- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Player Movement** - WASD/Arrow key controls with precise collision detection
- **Bomb System** - Strategic bomb placement with animated explosions
- **Map System** - Procedurally generated maps with destructible elements
- **Asset Management** - Efficient sprite loading and scaling system

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## �� Controls

- **WASD/Arrow Keys** - Player movement
- **Spacebar** - Place bomb
- **ESC** - Pause game
- **Enter** - Confirm menu selections

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

The game implements a state-based architecture with clear component separation:

- **State Manager** - Handles transitions between different game states
- **Level System** - Manages core gameplay logic and rendering
- **Component Modules** - Isolated systems for player, bombs, map, and assets
- **Configuration** - Centralized settings for easy modification

## 🔧 Development Notes

Built with scalability in mind, the architecture supports easy extension for additional features such as multiplayer networking, power-ups, and enhanced gameplay mechanics. The modular design follows software engineering best practices for maintainability and code organization.
